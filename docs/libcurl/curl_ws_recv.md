# NAME

curl_ws_recv - receive WebSocket data

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_ws_recv(CURL *curl, void *buffer, size_t buflen,
                      size_t *recv, const struct curl_ws_frame **meta);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

This function call is EXPERIMENTAL.

Retrieves as much as possible of a received WebSocket data fragment into the
**buffer**, but not more than **buflen** bytes. *recv* is set to the
number of bytes actually stored.

The *meta* pointer gets set to point to a *const struct curl_ws_frame*
that contains information about the received data. See the
curl_ws_meta(3) for details on that struct.

If there is more fragment data to deliver than what fits in the provided
*buffer*, libcurl returns a full buffer. The bytesleft member of *meta*
indicates how many additional bytes are expected to arrive as part of the
current fragment. The application needs to call this function again to continue
to retrieve more bytes.

The call returns **CURLE_AGAIN** if there is no data to read - the socket is
used in non-blocking mode internally. When **CURLE_AGAIN** is returned, use
your operating system facilities like *select(2)* to wait for data. The
socket may be obtained using curl_easy_getinfo(3) with
CURLINFO_ACTIVESOCKET(3).

Wait on the socket only if curl_ws_recv(3) returns **CURLE_AGAIN**.
The reason for this is libcurl or the SSL library may internally cache some
data, therefore you should call curl_ws_recv(3) until all data is
read which would include any cached data.

# EXAMPLE

~~~c
int main(void)
{
  size_t rlen;
  const struct curl_ws_frame *meta;
  char buffer[256];
  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    CURLcode res = curl_ws_recv(curl, buffer, sizeof(buffer), &rlen, &meta);
    if(res)
      printf("error: %s\n", curl_easy_strerror(res));
  }
}
~~~

# AVAILABILITY

Added in 7.86.0.

# RETURN VALUE

Returns **CURLE_OK** if everything is okay, and a non-zero number for
errors. Returns **CURLE_GOT_NOTHING** if the associated connection is
closed.

Instead of blocking, the function returns **CURLE_AGAIN**. The correct
behavior is then to wait for the socket to signal readability before calling
this function again.
