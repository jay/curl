.TH curl_mime_data 3 "22 August 2017" "libcurl 7.56.0" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_mime_data - set a mime part's body data from memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLcode curl_mime_data(curl_mimepart * " part ", const char * " data
.BI ", size_t " datasize ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
curl_mime_data() sets a mime part's body content from memory data.

\fIdata\fP points to the data bytes: those are copied to the part and their
storage may safely be reused after call.
\fIdatasize\fP is the number of data bytes: it can be set to
\fICURL_ZERO_TERMINATED\fP to indicate \fIdata\fP is a nul-terminated
character string.
\fIpart\fP is the part's to assign contents to.

Setting a part's contents twice is valid: only the value set by the last call
is retained. It is possible to unassign part's contents by setting
\fIdata\fP to NULL.

Setting very large data is memory consuming: one might consider using
\fIcurl_mime_data_cb\fP() in such a case.

.SH AVAILABILITY
As long as at least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in 7.56.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
CURLE_OK or a CURL error code upon failure.
